USER QUESTION: Is coconut above the apple

### REASONING

1. Find object named "coconut" → id is not provided, so we use the name directly: "coconut".
2. Find object named "apple" → id is not provided, so we use the name directly: "apple".
3. Check if there is a direct relationship between "coconut" and "apple". No direct relationship found.
4. Check if there is a relationship between "coconut" and "orange" (since "orange" is on top of "apple"). Relationship found: "coconut" "on" "orange".
5. Check if there is a relationship between "orange" and "apple". Relationship found: "orange" "on" "apple".
6. Since "coconut" is on "orange" and "orange" is on "apple", we can't say that "coconut" is directly above "apple". However, by transitivity, we can say that "coconut" is above "apple" indirectly.

### FINAL ANSWER

The coconut is above the apple indirectly.
