# Neurosymbolic-Commonsense-Reasoner

This is our approach to building a NeuroSymbolic AI system capable of commonsense reasoning in both textual and visual domains. We present a hybrid pipeline that leverages the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) while grounding reasoning in structured symbolic logic. For the textual task, we utilize Mistral-7B-Instruct to extract predicates from the CLUTRR dataset, employing a local Prolog solver for multi-hop inference and Mistral-7B-Instruct again to generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. For the visual task, we implement a multi-stage "Eye-Brain-Judge" pipeline following the ESCA Framework that uses DETR (ResNet-50) for object localization and LLaVA for scene graph generation enforced by geometric verification. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of separating semantic parsing from logical execution
